# SAT16 Relays board control software

## Usage

### Funtion 0x38 (Multiple relays control)

Set relay 1 to ON and all others to OFF

```c
./sat16ctrl -comport:/dev/ttyUSB0 -address:0x20 -write:380100
```

Set all relays to ON

```c
./sat16ctrl -comport:/dev/ttyUSB0 -address:0x20 -write:38FFFF
```

### Funtion 0x34 (One relay control)

Switch on relay 1

```c
./sat16ctrl -comport:/dev/ttyUSB0 -address:0x20 -write:3401FF
```

Switch on relay 6

```c
./sat16ctrl -comport:/dev/ttyUSB0 -address:0x20 -write:3406FF
```

Switch off relay 1

```c
./sat16ctrl -comport:/dev/ttyUSB0 -address:0x20 -write:340100
```

Switch on relay 3 during 4 seconds

```c
./sat16ctrl -comport:/dev/ttyUSB0 -address:0x20 -write:340304
```
